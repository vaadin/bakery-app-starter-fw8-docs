== Running, building and packaging.

=== Running the first time
After downloading and extracting the zip package, it is recommended to run the software once and see that it is working.

You can start up the project, for the first time and while developing, from the terminal with the help of Maven command `mvn spring-boot:run`. You can also use any IDE with Maven integration to run the `spring-boot:run` goal.

=== Building the package
To build the project, the standard `maven install` command can be used. This will produce a deployable, self containing jar in the target package

=== Running integration tests
[red background-yellow]*This will be under a separate profile in the future. Today it is under mvn install.*
