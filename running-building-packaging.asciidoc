= Running, building and packaging.

== Running the first time
After downloading and extracting the zip package, it is recommended to run the software once and see that it is working.

To start the Spring version, run `mvn spring-boot:run` from the terminal or your IDE.

To start the JavaEE version, run `mvn wildfly:run` from the terminal or your IDE.

== Building the package
To build the project, the standard `mvn install` command can be used. This will produce a deployable, self containing jar in the target package

== Running integration tests
Integration tests are run with the `mvn verify -Pit` command.

UI tests can take a while to run, so the integration tests are in a separate `it` profile, to provide a little bit more flexibility.
